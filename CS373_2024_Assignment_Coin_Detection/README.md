# 2024_S1_CS373_AssignmentSkeleton

This repository provides a Python 3 code skeleton for the image processing assignment of CompSci 373 in Semester 1, 2024.

This assignment will require you to use what we have studied in the image processing lectures to generate a software that detects New Zealand coins in the images that we have provided in the ```Images/easy``` and ```Images/hard``` folders.

You will receive 10 marks for solving the coin detection problem, and there will be an additional component for 5 marks, where you will extend upon the coin detection in a separate file, and write a short reflective report about your extension.

For more detailed description of the assignment, please see the assignment slides.
